<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Ville.Clean

**ville.Clean** is a [Qooxdoo](https://qooxdoo.org/) theme inspired by [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).

**Additional Benefits**
* Reduced reliance on external images for basic control graphics such as arrows, radio buttons and window buttons (all done with qooxdoo appearance and decoration entries)
* Leveraged SVG files for decoration images where possible to improve image sharpness
